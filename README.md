# First-OOP-project-First-Git-repo
This is OOP project from Elashad's Karimov Udemy Python course. I'm also learning Git so I decided to do simulation of SW development in connection with Git versioning system. 
I'm sure a lot of things could be done better, thus I appreciate any helpful suggestions.
